Ask the user for height between 1 and 8 both inclusive
if user enters wrong input, i.e. height not between 1 and 8
    go to step 1
print a " ", space
count the spaces enter, like pos = 1
take a count of lines and start from backward, like lines is equal to height
if space is less than height
    go to step 6
print a '#' till the height
move the cursor to next line
reduce the lines by 1
if line is greater than 0
    go to step 4
